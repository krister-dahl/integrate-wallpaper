Wallpaper integration for Stephan Raabes dotfiles
First of all, credits to Stephan Raabe - ML4W for his hard work on his dotfiles üôè
This scripts integrates the wallpaper completely for hyprland and qtile.

1. Logging out of hyprland sets sddm login screen to currently selected wallpaper.
2. Changing wallpaper in qtile sets sddm login screen to currently selected wallpaper.
3. Shutdown or rebooting from hyprland or qtile sets ssdm login screen to currently selected wallpaper.
4. Install an alternative hyprlock.conf. If you play music (f.ex spotify) the artist and track is displayed on the lockscreen below the clock and passwordfield.
The script is in 4 stages so all 4 could be installed individually.

How to use:
1. Run integrate-wallpaper.sh (all files changed by the script is backed up).
2. If you want to restore the changes run uninstall.sh and all files backed up will be restored and all new added files will be removed.

I am planning to keep this repo updated for every new release of the ML4W dotfiles, or as long its not implemented in the dotfiles by Stephan.

Hope you like it, and please read through the scripts so you are aware of what changes the script does.
